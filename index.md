Though some travelers have expressed concern that Vallarta has grown too much in recent years, the town’s geography has imposed clear boundaries, allowing development to gradually expand to the north and south of the central downtown area. Within the town itself, the city government has strict guidelines that ensure the architectural integrity of Vallarta, and in recent years has implemented a successful campaign to maintain the cleanliness of the town.
Nuevo Vallarta is found to the north of the Puerto Vallarta international airport, and is actually located in a different state, Nayarit. A planned community, it has evolved into a sister destination of Puerto Vallarta, with ultra-modern hotels, many of them all-inclusive, dominating the wide, beautiful, stretch of beach. This area has a secluded sense of privacy; however, to date, it offers little in the way of dining, shopping, or nightlife outside the hotels. A new festival shopping center, slated to open in the summer of 2000, should increase these options, and transportation into Puerto Vallarta — about 30 minutes by taxi — is readily available. Nuevo Vallarta is also the place to kayak a lagoon or swim with dolphins.
Located just north of downtown, Marina Vallarta is the site of modern hotels and wide beaches. It is a resort within a resort, with a championship golf course, ample tennis facilities, and an exclusive marina filled with yachts, sailing vessels, and charter boats. Surrounding the marina are numerous boutiques, restaurants, and travel agencies, plus all types of services to accommodate arriving cruisers. Condominiums, many available for vacation rental, surround the marina as well. This fashionable neighborhood is a favorite with families, and offers the best array of activities and entertainment for the younger traveler — including a water park and mammoth video arcade and entertainment center. Since this development sits on a swampy area that has been filled in, the beaches in Marina Vallarta are less attractive than those in other areas of town, and are occasionally very rocky. The grand hotels make up for this with their dazzling pools, but anyone whose heart is set on true “beach time” should consider another option.
El Centro, the historic downtown area, is known for its traditional white buildings, cobblestone streets, and the malecón, the broad seaside walkway bordered by Vallarta’s most populated restaurants and bars, and the centerpiece of local life and many visitor photos. Sunday evenings in particular — the traditional evening for a family stroll — are perfect for people watching. All along the malecón, public sculptures are dotted, many backed by local legends or lore. The recently installed grouping of sea fantasy sculptures by Mexican master Alejandro Colunga regularly attracts a crowd — sitting on, climbing over, or simply gazing upon these whimsical works of art. This is home for most of the businesses and galleries. Also known as Viejo Vallarta it is comprised of the signature cobblestone village extending to the north and south of the Cuale River, and it exemplifies Mexico at its traditional best.
Northern Beaches and Towns
Further north beyond Nuevo Vallarta are a succession of small towns and relatively undeveloped beaches, in easy reach by car. Just a few kilometers to the east, traditional Mexican farming life goes its unhurried way up steep mountain roads where views can be superb and well worth the extra drive. The simple and the sensational seem to coexist so easily here.
At the very northern top of Banderas Bay, where the bay, the Pacific Ocean, and Sea of Cortez meet, lies Punta Mita. Long known as a place of high spiritual energy, this is now the home of a new Four Seasons Resort and Jack Nicklaus golf course, with more high-end development planned. Sayulita and San Francisco are two intriguing towns located north of Banderas Bay, on the Pacific Ocean. These two beach towns offer quiet, rustic alternatives to Puerto Vallarta. Both offer limited, mostly casual beach dining, and are popular with surfers and backpackers.
For years, Manzanillo has been known for its wide, curving beaches, legendary sportfishing, and a highly praised diversity of dive sites. Now however, between its own golf links and those located up the northern coast, it is rivaling Los Cabos as the emerging golf capital of Mexico.
Manzanillo has an enticingly tropical geography, comprised of vast groves of tall palms, abundant mango trees, and successive coves graced with smooth sand beaches. To the north, mountains blanketed with palms rise alongside the shoreline. And over it all lies the veneer of perfect weather — balmy temperatures and year-round sea breezes. Even the approach by plane into Manzanillo showcases the promise of a perfect vacation — you fly in over the beach and golf course.
The town embraces the beautiful Bay of Zihuatanejo with the downtown area to the north, and the beautiful long beach of Playa Larga to the east. The heart of Zihuatanejo is the waterfront boardwalk, Paseo del Pescador, also referred to as the malecón. Unlike most Mexican towns, Zihuatanejo doesn’t have a main square or Plaza de Armas. Instead, the centerpiece of the downtown promenade is La Cancha, a basketball court, that serves as the gathering place for bands that play on Sunday evenings, and vendors who offer tamales and elotes (corn) for sale, along with sweet homemade popsicles flavored with chocolate, cinnamon, or vanilla.
Ixtapa also has its share of trendy shops and boutiques, plus lively nightlife, and refined dining. A bicycle track begins at the marina, continues around the golf course, and heads on towards the northern beach of Playa Linda.
Playa Linda is located 12km (8 miles) north of Ixtapa. This is a long beach with golden sands that seem to stretch endlessly to the north. It is the primary out-of-town beach, with water sports equipment rentals, fishing charters, and horseback riding. The ferry to Isla Ixtapa leaves from the jetty located on the southern end of Playa Linda.
Troncones is a tiny fishing village located 30 km (20 miles) northwest of Ixtapa, where visitors can absolutely escape from it all. There is little more to do here beyond strolling along the beach, swimming, and savoring the fresh local seafood. This place offers several options for overnight stays from an exclusive B&B to RV facilities, as well as camping on the beach. No public buses serve this town, so you’ll have to hire a taxi to take you there, and arrange for the same taxi to pick you up when you are ready to return.
Though Acapulco is, admittedly, past its prime, there are still plenty of reasons to visit and numerous ways to enjoy the famously sunny days there. Acapulco remains Mexico’s most traditional resort for those looking for a beach, yet also want to feel as if they’ve been to Mexico. Where other resorts in Mexico have been accused of being homogenized to meet the tastes of North American travelers, Acapulco remains true to her essence, from the cacophony of families filling colorful, public sands, to the classically late nights in glitzy clubs.
The one cautionary note concerns the reputed lack of cleanliness in Acapulco, especially in the waters of Acapulco Bay. Great strides have been made in cleaning up the pollution that was widely reported in the 1970s and 1980s. However, the water remains less pristine than in resorts to the north and south, and most visitors — wisely — prefer to swim in hotel pools. A public works program put in place in the 1990s, ACA-Limpia, has also made progress in cleaning up the beaches and other public areas, including the heavily-trafficked Costera. More than 20 powerboat sweepers are dispatched each day to skim any floating debris from the water’s surface. More important, needed improvements in infrastructure — estimated at over a billion dollars — are nearing completion, which should also improve the cleanliness of the city and bay.
Although it stretches for almost 25 km (15.5 miles) around the bay, Acapulco can roughly be divided into three main areas. The historic downtown is located on the northwestern edge of the bay while the Costera, home of the high-rise lineup of hotels and a wide stretch of golden beach, lies in the center. Las Brisas and Acapulco Diamante areas — handily the most exclusive addresses in Acapulco — are found south of Acapulco Bay.
Located about seven miles north of town, accessible by public bus or taxi, is the northern beach area, Pie de la Cuesta, with its scenic sandbar and numerous seaside restaurants. The adjacent Coyuca Lagon was the shooting location for Rambo II, filmed in 1985, one of more than 250 movies that have been shot in Acapulco. Even more significant, this tropical estuary is rich with bird life, and has become the focus of current eco-tourism efforts. Bordered by palm trees, the bay at the mouth of this freshwater lagoon is a popular site for water skiing. Boat rides through several canals can stop at Isla de los Pajaros for lunch. Mudbaths and spectacular sunset viewing are additional attractions, and palapa restaurants are available where you can dine. Be aware that the water is very rough, and swimming is not recommended in the open sea.
Taxco is located 275 km (165 miles) north of Acapulco, and can be reached in about three hours by car, traveling the toll road (about US$20). Guided tours traveling by bus are also available through most Acapulco travel agencies or hotel hospitality desks.
The beaches to the north and south of Puerto Escondido are interspersed with lagoons, estuaries, and mangrove swamps, which contribute to making this region a fertile ecological paradise. About 24 km (15 miles) west of Puerto Escondido is Laguna Manialtepec, a deep lagoon, thick with vegetation and brimming with tropical birds, including the ibis, a variety of herons, parrots, egrets, and several species of ducks.
The 50-square mile national park, Lagunas de Chacahua is located 66 km (41 miles) to the north of Puerto Escondido. It is comprised of 32 km (20 miles) of fine, sandy beaches, backed by a pair of lagoons and jungle mangroves teeming with a changing array of tropical and migratory birds. Though crocodiles were hunted out in the 1970s, a crocodile hatchery in the village of Chacahua, located on the western edge of the lagoon, is steadily bringing them back.
Heading into the foothills of the Sierra de Miahuatlán, located north of Puerto Escondido, are numerous trails for hiking or horseback riding. This mountainous jungle region also features a few places of particular interest, including the Atotonilco hot springs, considered to be healing waters by the indigenous Chatino residents of the area. The El Macuil waterfall is not only a spectacular site, but offers cool, natural freshwater pools for swimming. Another waterfall can be enjoyed near the mountain village of San Gabriel Mixtepec, a small town nestled between several coffee plantations. Nearby, the Mixtec village of Jamiltepec offers a rare look at a quiet, traditional, indigenous town.
The mountainous region north of Huatulco is considered a prime area for the production of pluma coffee, a Mexican coffee noted for its powerful aroma and rich, earthy flavor. Visits to the various coffee fincas (plantations), located just under two hours north of Crucecita by car, make for an interesting day or overnight trip. The production zone for Huatulco’s coffee is comprised of over 50,000 hectares (100,000 acres), in the small towns surrounding the Copalita River. Notable are the continued use of traditional cultivation methods with minimal use of agricultural chemicals, and the open-air drying of the beans in sun beds.
The mountain areas surrounding the Capalita River are also the site of many natural treasures, including the Capalitilla Cascades. About 30 km (18.5 miles) north of Tangolunda a grouping of waterfalls, with heights averaging 25 m (80 feet) form natural Jacuzzis and clear pools for swimming. The area is also popular for horseback riding and rappelling.

./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Berlin-History.txt:The final push which led to the collapse of the Berlin Wall came when an ecological campaign in Leipzig against nuclear weapons and industrial pollution grew into nationwide pressure for democratic freedom. In 1989, with thousands of East Germans fleeing to the West via Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, the country was swept up in the wave of eastern European revolutions unleashed by the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. His visit to East Berlin in October 1989 for the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic left it clear that Soviet troops would no longer shore up its regime. The Berlin Wall was opened on 9 November 1989, and at midnight on 3 October 1990, a huge black, red, and gold national flag was hoisted at the Reichstag. East and West Berlin were again one.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bermuda-WhereToGo.txt:Drive past the sheltered inlet of Coot Pond to reach Fort St. Catherine itself. (Or you can take a minibus, which runs from King’s Square to the fort every 15 minutes.) The setting of the fort — on a rocky promontory with sandy beaches on both flanks — is spectacular, with strong walls rising on all sides. The fort was begun as early as 1614 but has been upgraded throughout Bermuda’s history. Major renovations took place in 1793, 1820, and 1840 as technology improved and weaponry developed. The last major upgrade was completed in 1878. Explore the outer walls and impressive battlements before visiting the exhibitions housed in the interior. Collections of antique weapons, including swords and muskets, outline the progress made in weapons technology. Replicas of the crown jewels housed in the Tower of London can also be found here. An audiovisual presentation gives a comprehensive overview of all the fortifications on Bermuda.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-History.txt:For the West Coast peoples, as the song says, the living was easy. The fish were indeed jumping; bountiful salmon were barbecued in the summertime, smoked for the winter. Prehistoric techniques for fishing and trapping have continued right into modern times, though bone has been replaced by steel in the weapons. One of British Columbia’s favorite freshwater fishing sites, at Hell’s Gate in Fraser Canyon, has been going strong for 9,000 years. Prairie Indians hunted buffalo by forcing the herds onto marshland, snowbanks, thin ice, or over cliffs — one of these nasty surprises being known to this day as the Head-Smashed-In buffalo jump, near Fort MacLeod, Alberta. Already in 3000 b.c. these people were drying and smoking strips of meat — modern beef jerky. In Ontario and Québec, where encroaching forests gradually dispersed the herds of caribou, the Iroquois ousted the Algonquin and settled down to cultivate maize, beans, and squash, living in rectangular, multifamily longhouses.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:In the middle of the island, close to where the French army burned its flags in Montréal’s military capitulation to the British in 1760, the D.M. Stewart Museum is a restoration of the fort commissioned by the Duke of Wellington 60 years later. The military drills and parades staged here in the summer by uniformed students pay appropriate homage to both French and British (more precisely, the Scots Highlander) tradition. The fort’s Military and Maritime Museum displays ship models, maps, navigational instruments, and Canada’s weapons and uniforms from the 17th century to World War II. Beyond Jacques Cartier Bridge, La Ronde amusement park plays every imaginable ultramodern variation on the swings and roundabouts of a country fair. Put the kids on the Gyrotron whirligig or Aquapark waterslide and watch (or forget about them) from the beer garden. The closest Montréal can take you to the tropics is among its exotic fish in the Aquarium on the other side of Dolphin Lake (Lac des Dauphins) from the waterslide park.

./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:Also on the harbor, the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic (1675 Lower Water Street,) is housed in a turn-of-the-century ship chandlery, setting the tone with a nostalgic whiff of tarred rope in the restored shop on the ground floor. The museum traces the dockyards’ 200-year history, displaying naval instruments, weapons, and some superb ship models from sail to steam, including the Aquitania ocean liner. A special section is devoted to shipwrecks on the notorious Sable Island. Berthed at the museum’s wharf is the 1913 survey vessel, Acadia, that charted the coasts of eastern Canada from Nova Scotia to Hudson Bay.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:For a good panoramic view of Halifax and a sense of its important military history, make your way around the grassy slopes leading to the star-shaped Citadel, from which a cannon-shot has boomed across the town each day at noon since the 1850s. A good guided tour takes you around the garrison, originally built for 300 British soldiers. It is surrounded by a deep, wide, dry moat, thick walls, and fortified grass-covered earthworks. The Cavalier Building has been restored to the way it was in 1869 and is now an Army Museum with uniforms, weapons, and the models of three previous city fortresses. The South Magazine stored powder barrels uncomfortably close to military prisoners who were kept, with the cannons, in the Garrison Cells. Canadian troops used the Citadel as barracks in both world wars, while anti-aircraft batteries were installed there in World War II. In summer, students in the kilted uniform of the 78th Highlanders perform infantry and artillery drills. The Nova Scotia Tattoo stages more spectacular military bagpipe parades, highland dances, singing, and a Naval Gun Run competition at the nearby Halifax Metro Center in late June, early July.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:The town’s most attractive piece of greenery is Point Pleasant Park, whose beach and shady woods make it ideal for picnics. At the southern tip of the Halifax peninsula, the park provides a fine vantage point from which to watch the big ships in the harbor and the yachts on the Northwest Arm. Among old ruined fortifications is the still intact Prince of Wales Martello Tower, a massive stone structure serving as barracks, weapons storage, and artillery platform, built by Prince Edward in 1796.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:Spend a more sober moment in the fascinating Glenbow Museum (130 Ninth Avenue S.E.). Beautifully arranged exhibits of furniture, costumes, utensils, and weapons give a vivid picture of Alberta life, from the pioneers’ log-cabin homesteads to the modern artifacts of oil-drillers, railway-builders, and miners. One evocative exhibit of the Great Depression of the 1930s is a farm girl’s party dress bejeweled with scores of safety pins arranged in patterns. The life of Ojibwa and Cree Indians is displayed in tepees, magnificent buffalo robes, and beaded buckskin, dance masks, and snowshoes.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt:Christopher Columbus knew these streets, and he prayed at the Ermita de San Antonio Abad before setting off on his first Voyage of Discovery to the New World. The present building dates from the 18th century. Close by on Calle Colón is the beautiful 15th-century Casa de Colón; this elegant house with its charming courtyard was formerly the residence of the island’s first governor, and Columbus is said to have stayed here on three occasions. Now an atmospheric museum, it recreates the Age of Discovery with exhibits of navigational instruments, charts, weapons, and everyday items of the period.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Cancun-History.txt:In 1847, a savage uprising known as the Caste War saw Mayan rebels massacre white settlers and take control of nearly two-thirds of the peninsula. By 1850 they had driven the Mexicans back to their strongholds in Mérida and Campeche. However, in an amazing turnaround, the Maya’s ancient beliefs became their undoing. Just when the Mexicans were on the point of surrender, the rains came early and the Indians, obedient to their gods, dropped their weapons and returned to their milpas to plant the sacred corn. The settlers called in reinforcements and wreaked a terrible revenge on the natives. One group of rebels, known as the Chan Santa Cruz, held out in the jungles of Quintana Roo around the city of Tulum, harrying the Mexicans and making the east coast of the Yucatán a dangerous area, off-limits until well into the 20th century.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Nepal-WhereToGo.txt:On the road back to town, stop at the National Museum to admire its small but select collection of art and artifacts. Here are Licchavi stone reliefs of Shiva and Parvati from the fifth and sixth centuries, the classical period of sculpture. Figures are slimmer and more graceful than the more common balloon-breasted models of the Mallas. A lovely eighth-century Birth of Buddha is curiously reminiscent of Christian nativity scenes. A great Bhairav urn and a comical terra-cotta Ganesh are noteworthy. There’s also a separate wing that holds a collection of Buddhist iconography. The historical wing is filled with ancient weapons, including a leather cannon that must have given gunners a few anxious moments.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:El Morro was one of the most formidable citadels in the world. During the 16th and 17th centuries it was one of a ring of forts that held the key to Spanish power in the Caribbean. The watchtowers of El Morro look out to sea and inland across San Juan Bay to the coastal plains beyond. The multilevel defenses made it possible to fire weapons from sea level up to hundreds of feet above ground. Despite some serious attempts by English and Dutch forces, the fort was never forcibly taken.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:Take a left and a block farther down you’ll enter Plaza de Armas.

The army used to drill here, hence the name (armas means weapons, or arms), but today it is simply a place for people to meet and have a coffee, or sit and chat. Workers enjoy picnic lunches here at midday; old people while away the afternoon. The Alcaldía has an interesting interior, with checkerboard marble floors and magnificent chandeliers. It’s usually open on weekdays; you can check with the tourist information office on the ground floor as to whether it’s OK to wander around.

Where to Go
Puerto Rico is an island of contrasts, perhaps the only destination in the Caribbean where the city streets hold as much allure as the beaches. One third of the island’s population of just over three million live in San Juan, which is undoubtedly the draw for many. One of the leading commercial and industrial centers of the Caribbean, it is characterized by high-rise office blocks and sprawling suburbs. It’s the delights and historical treasures of the old town, however, that capture the eyes and imaginations of most visitors. And beyond the limits of the capital are mountains, rivers and lakes, forests, and plantations waiting to be explored.
Old San Juan
Old San Juan is without doubt one of the most spectacular sights of the Caribbean. Founded in 1521, it is partially surrounded by walls and fortifications that have protected it from modernization and indiscriminate development. The carefully preserved historic houses and public buildings retain many of the most charming features of the original Spanish colonial architecture. Cobblestone streets (the stones were brought as ballast on the Spanish ships, which went home filled with treasure and gold), tiny squares, and grand plazas surprise visitors at every turn as they wander the neat grid of streets planned four centuries ago.
Only eight blocks wide, San Juan can easily be covered on foot, though there are some steep ascents that may be challenging in the Caribbean heat. Even if you only have one day, you’ll be able to enjoy its delights. If possible, however, take at least a couple of days. Enjoying a rest in a shady plaza or taking a long lunch at an outdoor café are just as much a part of your trip as a tour around the museums. San Juan is a living city, and it’s especially bustling after dark, when crowds throng to the bars and restaurants or simply stroll the narrow streets and airy plazas.
Begin your exploration at Plaza de Colón (Columbus Square). If you take a taxi from the outlying resort areas, this is a good place to alight — before traffic in the narrow streets forces your vehicle to a halt. The square was named after Columbus on the 400th anniversary of Puerto Rico’s discovery, in 1893. After admiring the unusually tall statue of the discoverer, leave the square from the northeastern corner and walk along Boulevard del Valle; this is a pretty street with a series of brightly painted buildings, but the traffic can be busy.
At the top of the hill, on the right, you’ll find the towering walls of Fuerte San Cristóbal, the largest fort in Puerto Rico. It’s also the youngest fort on the island, built in the 18th century to plug a hole in the easterly defenses of the city. From atop the brick walls, which withstood fierce attacks by cannonballs and other projectiles, you can enjoy panoramic views out to the east and over San Juan Bay to the modern city. The fort’s vast interior courtyard now echoes with the sound of running children rather the marching of soldier’s boots, but one dormitory of the old barracks has been re-created, with bunks lining the walls and uniforms hung neatly on pegs. Take the long dark walk to the dungeons to find a faded drawing of a Spanish galleon sketched on the wall by a captain accused of treason.
After visiting the fort continue west along Boulevard del Valle, which becomes Calle Norzagaray. Here you’ll be tempted by fine views of the sea; you may even catch sight of a cruise ship sailing gracefully into port. This route sits against the old city walls, which were completed in 1785, and from here it is easy to see why the city was thought to be impregnable. Thanks to the high, thick walls and the watch-towers with their distinctive rounded roofs, the residents could be sure that no one would approach unseen.
After a walk of about half a mile you’ll find the plain façade of the Museo de Arte e Historia (San Juan Museum of Art and History) on your left. Once a major market place for the city, built in 1855, the building now houses a major collection of Puerto Rican art.
Just past the museum, a large, open grassy area comes into view. If you happen to be here on a weekend you’ll find thousands of Puerto Rican families out flying kites. This area is the best place to take advantage of the sea breezes, and many kites soar hundreds of feet up in the air. When collisions occur or lines get crossed, jovial banter breaks out between the parties — it’s a very social activity. The grassy area, cut by one gravel path, leads to the end of the promontory — and the mighty Fuerte San Felipe del Morro, usually simply referred to as “El Morro” (meaning “the headland”). On your right as you walk toward the entrance you’ll pass the old city cemetery resting between the walls and the sea. The ornate tombs are still carefully attended and hold the remains of some of Puerto Rico’s most illustrious families. The entrance to El Morro is reached across a wide dry moat, a last defense against attack. Walk through the huge curved doorway to the heart of the fort.
Since 1845 the lighthouse here has provided protection for ships off the coast; the present light dates from 1908. The old barracks and ammunition arsenal now house a museum, which offers an audio-visual presentation about the history of the fort (in English and Spanish on alternate half hours).
After exploring the fort, walk back across the grassy lawns. (At the small traffic circle at the end of the driveway you’ll find refreshment stalls where you can get a cool drink or snack before moving on.) Young Puertorriqueños have taken to skateboarding and rollerblading on nearby Plaza del Quartel Ballajá. They gather every day at this square to compete with their peers and show off their skills to passersby.
To the left is Cuartel de Ballajá (Ballajá Barracks), once the major army barracks under Spanish rule and now a significant cultural attraction. The second floor of the building houses the Museum of the Americas. The museum’s mission is to gather collections of artifacts of Amerindian culture, including folk art, basket-ware from Colombia, and ceremonial masks and costumes from around Central America.
The barracks themselves are also interesting — large open rooms that used to house soldiers and their families face in toward a large court, where drills were carried out. The square now remains eerily quiet (unless a school group is touring the museum).
Opposite the entrance to the Barracks is the long white building that houses the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. A new museum is planned for this space, but in the meantime temporary art exhibitions display the best of Puerto Rican painting and sculpture.
Follow Calle Beneficencia, the street leading off the right side of the barracks, back towards town. You’ll soon come to a small square on your left with a huge totemic sculpture. This is Plaza del Quinto Centenario (Quincentenary Square). The sculpture symbolizes the 500 years of Puerto Rico’s existence. On close inspection, Amerindian and Spanish themes can be seen, but some elements are a little obscure.
On the north flank of the square is the Spanish Gothic Iglesia San José (San José Church), the second-oldest church in the New World. The plain white façade reflects the sunlight, helping cool the interior. The body of Ponce de León was interred here for over 300 years before being moved to the San Juan Cathedral in 1908. Attached to the church is a large building that was originally a Dominican Convent. It was an army barracks until 1966, when it was taken under the auspices of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. You can enter the main square and see the three cloistered floors that flank it. Art exhibitions are held here regularly.
On the east side of Plaza San José are two important buildings. In the corner is the Pablo Casals Museum, dedicated to the life of the cello virtuoso and composer, who lived the last years of his life in Puerto Rico. Casals was responsible for injecting life back into the classical genre here; he sponsored a classical music festival which still takes place every June. Next to the Casals Museum is the Casa de los Contrafuertes (House of the Buttresses), named after the sturdy stone supports that reach out at angles from the walls. It is thought to be the oldest privately owned residence in Old San Juan, dating from the early 18th century. There are two museums on the upper floors: the Pharmacy Museum — a complete apothecary’s shop with bottles and scales — and above it, the Museum of Latin American Print.
Leave Plaza San José via Calle Cristo. Halfway down this street on your left you’ll find the Catedral de San Juan (San Juan Cathedral). The church dates from 1540, though a comprehensive restoration was carried out in the early 19th century. The interior features pretty trompe l’oeil details that add depth to the plain columns and domes. On the northern wall is the tomb of Ponce de León; he shares this place of honor with San Pío, a Catholic martyr whose remains were brought from Rome in 1862.
Facing the cathedral is Plazuela de las Monjas, a tiny square filled with trees, where courting couples and old folks take advantage of the shade. You may also catch the sound of jingling bells signaling that the local ice-cream seller is around. On the north side of the square is the El Convento Hotel, a great place to take a break. The hotel has an interesting history because, as the name suggests, it started life as a convent, in 1651. Unfortunately, as the number of nuns declined, the convent was forced to close, and the building, decaying year by year, played host to the best and busiest brothel in the city. It was also one of the cheapest hotels in town before being rescued and transformed in the early 1990s.
On the western flank of the square you’ll find the Museo del Niño (Children’s Museum). No sterile display cases full of artifacts here! This is an entertaining, hands-on activity center where kids can be kids and yet still have a learning experience. There are four floors of interactive exhibits, including a real dentist’s chair where mom or dad can be examined by their offspring, and a giant bubble machine on the upper floor.
Behind the museum are a number of other important attractions. Take Calle las Monjas toward San Juan Bay. After a short distance you’ll arrive at the western wall and a small square, Plazuela de la Rogativa, with a bronze statue commemorating the torchlight religious procession, or rogativa, that saved the city in 1797. It’s believed that the lights held by the bishop and the women of the city fooled the British forces in the bay into assuming that Spanish reinforcements had arrived. The British fled empty-handed.
Just a short walk north of the square is the Casa Blanca (White House), which for 250 years was the home of the descendants of Ponce de León. Something of a mini-fortress, safe behind its own high wall, the house itself is fascinating — the interior is a museum to life in 16th- and 17th-century San Juan, with many rooms full of period furniture.
Walk back toward the Plazuela de la Rogativa and peer over the city wall, which rises over 100 ft (301⁄2 m) at this point. The plain façade is broken by the San Juan Gate, which was once the only entrance to the city from the old port. The gate was constructed in 1639, and the walls were completed in 1641. Every person who traveled across the Atlantic from Spain would enter through this narrow passage — many would make their way directly to the Cathedral to give thanks for a safe arrival — and all goods were transported through here. The thick wooden doors are an impressive sight; they were locked and guarded each night but now remain open to allow people to stroll along the seafront.
Make your way back to the cathedral along Calle San Juan and turn right once again at Calle Cristo. You’ll pass some interesting shops that might tempt you to browse for a while (the designer outlet stores are particularly popular). Turn right at Calle Fortaleza to reach one of the jewels of San Juan: La Fortaleza. Now the home of the Governor of Puerto Rico, this fort is in fact a historic monument dating back to 1533. It was the first fortification built by the founders of San Juan and has been in constant use since that time. Of course it has grown over the centuries — you’ll find extensions and renovations in the Baroque, Gothic, and Neo-Classic styles. Now a National Historic Site, this fascinating home is full of period furniture. You can tour the house and its extensive gardens, but you must book in advance.
At the southern end of Calle Cristo, at the edge of the city wall, is tiny Capilla del Cristo. This chapel was said to have been built in the memory of a young man who, in 1753, raced his horse down Calle Cristo, was unable to stop the animal in time, and fell over the wall to his death. Others say that, in fact, the chapel was built to commemorate the fact that the boy was saved by divine intervention at this very spot. Whichever is true, the chapel now stands as a barrier to any other such mishap.
To the left of the chapel is 18th-century Casa del Libro (House of Books), a small museum devoted to rare books and the printing and binding arts. Next door is the Centro Nacional de Artes y Artesanías (Popular Arts and Crafts Center), a showcase of modern art and crafts managed by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. Temporary exhibitions are mounted here, and some items are occasionally made available for purchase.
To the right of the chapel is the entrance to Parque de las Palomas (Pigeon Park), clinging to the side of the city wall and a favorite with children. The park can be a little oppressive — it’s always a flurry of people and pigeons — but at least pause long enough to admire the panoramic views across San Juan harbor.
Take a left and a block farther down you’ll enter Plaza de Armas. This was the first central square of Old San Juan, and the City Hall, or Alcaldía, still sits on its northern side. The army used to drill here, hence the name (armas means weapons, or arms), but today it is simply a place for people to meet and have a coffee, or sit and chat. Workers enjoy picnic lunches here at midday; old people while away the afternoon. The Alcaldía has an interesting interior, with checkerboard marble floors and magnificent chandeliers. It’s usually open on weekdays; you can check with the tourist information office on the ground floor as to whether it’s OK to wander around.
Back on Calle Fortaleza, walk east until you reach the Casa de Callejón (House of the Alley) on the corner of Callejón de Capilla. A fine example of an 18th-century house, it is now the Museum of the Puerto Rican Family, full of the furniture, toys, and other daily artifacts of a well-to-do San Juan family.    
Taking a left out of the museum brings you back to Plaza Colón, from where you can make your way south toward San Juan harbor. Along the way you’ll pass Teatro Tapia (Tapia Theater) named after Puerto Rican playwright Alejandro Tapia y Rivera. The splendid façade was restored in 1976, the interior remodeled in 1987. The theater hosts regular performances of ballet, dance, and drama, often showcasing works by modern Puerto Rican writers and choreographers.
You can’t miss the harbor. Just look for the huge cruise ships, which dwarf the surrounding buildings. The cruise port comprises several large jetties, from whence hundreds of passengers disembark on a regular basis. Walk west along the seafront in the direction of the town. Next to the ultramodern cruise-ship wharfs you’ll will find the rather down-at-the-heel commercial ferry jetty, which caters to the small boats that ply across the harbor to the modern city. Taking one of these little boats is one of the best ways to take in the size of the harbor and the old town. You’ll also get to see Puerto Ricans at work, and and play — snacking on empanadillas (pastry turnovers filled with meat or cheese) and enjoying salsa music.
Near the ferry dock, across Calle Marina, you’ll see the rising edifice of the San Juan Post Office, a magnificent building with Art-Deco features. In front of the post office is a tiny tourist information office, La Casita, where you can pick up maps and information.
Metropolitan San Juan
Toward the end of the 18th century, the city fathers realized that San Juan was becoming overcrowded, so they decided to break through a section of the vast wall and expand the city’s borders. Gangs of laborers were hired to carry out the job (you can see photographs of them in Fuerte San Cristóbal). This action altered the perception that San Juan was a citadel city — already an anachronism at the time — and plans were drawn up to develop the area immediately east of the city, an area that became known as Puerta de Tierra or “gateway to the land.” Today, San Juan stretches all the way around the bay. A number of the modern suburbs, though primarily residential, have some interesting attractions for visitors.
Just outside the old town, facing out toward the sea, is the impressive El Capitolio, home of the Puerto Rico Legislature. Constructed in 1925, it has already been recognized as a historic monument. Continuing beyond this sight, you’ll pass some rather careworn buildings before reaching Parque Muñoz Rivera, one of the places where local families like to relax on the weekends. There are areas of formal gardens, a small fort, and children’s play area. A seafront promenade to the north sees hundreds of families strolling on warm weekend evenings; the beach, though very narrow, is the nearest one to the old city, and it’s always crowded in the afternoon and on weekends.
A series of bridges lead across a small strait to modern San Juan, or to the right to Condado and the resort area.
Hato Rey’s unexpected, futuristic skyline marks it as the financial center of the Caribbean. Those skyscrapers are banks, and the street on which they stand has been nicknamed the Milla de Oro, or Golden Mile. Río Piedras is the home of the University of Puerto Rico. Its considerable campus serves 42,000 students, and the university museum, in a modern one-story structure nearby, exhibits contemporary Puerto Rican paintings and sculptures, along with archaeological evidence of the talents of the island’s original Indian inhabitants.
More Indian relics, plus old Spanish coins and tiles, can be viewed in the Ponce de León Museum at Caparra, 4 miles (61⁄2 km) west of San Juan on Route 2. Alongside this small white museum are the ruins of the house Ponce de León built and from which he directed the colonization of the island. In 1521, after a number of outbreaks of disease, the capital was moved to San Juan, and Caparra was abandoned. What’s left of Ponce de León’s house looks like ancient Roman ruins, earnestly preserved.
Cataño is an industrial area visible directly across the bay from the old city. Most of its buildings, though important to the economy of the island, spoil the view, but one is of rather more interest to visitors. The Bacardi rum plant offers an interesting and well-organized free guided tour. Small motorized trains carry visitors to the distilling and bottling plants. Free samples are dispensed, and in the gift shop you can buy bottles to take back home. For those more interested in history than in the production of rum, there is a fascinating museum that relates the story of the Bacardi family (who still own the business), from their arrival in Cuba from Spain, to their flight to Puerto Rico after the Cuban revolution in 1959, to their influence on the global drinks market.
San Juan’s Resorts
Puerto Rico’s popularity as a holiday island has risen enormously since the early 1960s. Most of the development and tourist infrastructure lies in a narrow strip along the coast, east of San Juan. Condado was the first; it had already been on the map with the jet set and saw further expansion when a string of high-rise hotels were built along the long stretches of sandy beach. Its main street, Ashford Avenue, has something of the Art-Deco feel of Miami’s South Beach. As you stroll past the shops selling expensive top-drawer merchandise, you’re likely to pass a number of impeccably dressed older women carrying impeccably coiffed toy poodles. As time has passed, the young energy has moved east, taking advantage of available land, and now Isla Verde, farther along the coast, has been developed — some say overdeveloped. This is where all the real action is. A number of large hotels with theaters, casinos, and restaurants attract high-rollers. Fast-food restaurants, bars, and gift shops fill the streets. The two main beaches of Isla Verde are impressive (and they get very busy), but the resort is very close to the airport and can get a little noisy.
The Northeast
Heading east out of Isla Verde, it takes only a couple of minutes to leave the city behind. The coast road (Route 187) leads past the end of the runway at Muñoz Marín Airport on the left and Isla Verde’s balneario (public beach) on the right. Travel over the little bridge that spans the entrance to Laguna la Torrecilla, and suddenly you are in the countryside.
The road runs along the coastline and through the Bosque Estatal de Piñones, an area of beautiful sandy beaches and coconut palms that until recently was a pristine environment where sleepy cattle sat under the trees. It is now a popular weekend picnic spot for city families, many of whom leave their litter behind when they depart. This sort of carelessness spoils Piñones (and many other beauty spots on the eastern coastline within easy reach of San Juan); an assemblage of broken bottles, leftover food, litter, and worse is something you can’t fail to notice.
Head through Loíza, and on towards Río Grande. Here Route 187 meets Route 3, one of the major arterial roads around Puerto Rico; it’s a very busy highway, so be aware and drive carefully. Take a left and proceed to Route 191; then turn right and head up toward El Yunque (the Anvil), the most famous mountain in Puerto Rico. Normally capped with clouds it catches from the passing sea breezes, and sometimes entirely lost in a blanket of gray storm-clouds, the 3,496-ft (1,088-m) peak stands at the center of the Caribbean National Forest, an area of virgin rain forest preserved since 1876, when the island was still a Spanish colony. Originally a park of 12,300 acres (4,998 hectares), it now covers 28,000 acres (11,330 hectares) and is managed by the US Forestry Department.  
The whole area is a place of staggering proportions: there are over 200 species of native trees. One specimen is said to be over 2,500 years old; some trees are so wide it takes several people to reach around them; others soar hundreds of feet into the air. The forest gets over 180 inches (41���2 m) of rain each year — that’s some 100 billion gallons (450 billion liters) of water. The animals that live here are also amazing. This is one of the last habitats of the threatened Puerto Rican parrot. The infamous coquí (see page 47)is, of course, heard everywhere. All in all, the park in an impressive sight, with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance.
Arriving via Route 191 you’ll come right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park. This facility presents important information about the history of the park, its plant and animal species, and its role in the local ecology. You can then travel on higher into the park, toward the summit. You can’t drive the whole 8 miles (13 km) between the visitors center and the end of the road, but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way, so there’s ample access. Two popular stops are La Coca Falls, on the right after the 5-mile (8-km) point, and the Yokahú Observation Tower, at the 51⁄2-mile (9-km) point. Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes. The most spectacular cascade in the park, La Mina Falls, is just a 30-minute walk from the roadside, via Big Tree Trail.
Take a walk on any of the well-marked trails: the atmosphere is humid and the vegetation constantly damp (your best friends will be your insect repellent and your stout shoes), but the landscape is beautiful and fascinating.
El Yunque is included in many tours from San Juan; these usually include a trip to Luquillo Beach, which lies in the shadow of the peak, to the north. There is a popular balneario at Luquillo, which has restrooms, snack bars, and a children’s play area. The beach is kept tidy and there is ample parking.        
After Luquillo, Route 3 curves around toward the east coast of the island and to the town of Fajardo, which is a stepping-stone to the offshore islands of Vieques and Culebra. There is little to hold you in the town, except for a finger of land reaching north out into the ocean. Take Route 997 to explore this area. On the way, you’ll pass a large marina with fleets of charter boats and the El Conquistador Resort and Country Club with its golf course, marina, and private offshore island. At the very tip of the peninsula is Bahia la Cabezas and Las Cabezas de San Juan Nature Reserve, one of the newest reserves on the island. Acres of mangrove swamp cover the rocky outcrops, sheltering sandy beaches and providing a haven for herons and pelicans. You’ll see hermit crabs scurrying across the ground, hiding in their shells as you approach. Faro de Fajardo (Fajardo lighthouse) stands amid all the greenery, protecting ships from the shallows to the north and east.
Isla de Vieques and Culebra
The islands of Vieques and Culebra, off of Puerto Rico’s east coast, are a part of, yet in many ways totally separate from, the main island. The small populations here live a slower, more traditional life, and the headlong rush to get there yesterday, which you’ll experience in some of the cities and towns of Puerto Rico, doesn’t seem to exist here at all.
Vieques (pronounced be-ay-kase) is the largest of the two, though its name, from the Amerindian, means “small island.” It’s about 11⁄2 hours by ferry from the coast, or a 30-minute flight from Isla Grande Airport in San Juan. An island of wonderful sandy beaches and farmland, it is also home to a large US military reserve. Regular military flights may mar the tranquillity somewhat, but they can’t spoil the natural beauty. Much of the land has been leased back to farmers, and visitors can enjoy the wonderful beaches, although you’ll need some form of photo ID to gain access to them. On the south coast you’ll find Sun Bay and 3 miles (5 km) of fine government-run public beach (which was used as the location for the film Lord of the Flies). Nearby is Mosquito Bay, an appropriate name, since most of the island seems to have squadrons of the tiny winged beasts. This is a phosphorescent bay, and you can take a boat trip out into the water to agitate the microscopic organisms that give off the strange glow. It’s a fascinating experience. The show is always better on a moonless night.
The capital of the island is Isabel Segunda, named in honor of the 19th-century Spanish Queen who was on the throne when work began on the fort, in the 1840s. Its shady plaza sees a constant stream of visitors, but no one rushes. There’s little else to do but relax, and this is the real appeal of Vieques.      
Culebra, much smaller at 21 sq miles (34 sq km), is north of Vieques. It is the largest rock in a collection of over twenty that attract sailors and divers from the main island. Culebra was known as the Spanish Virgin Island until the American takeover — it lies halfway between Puerto Rico and St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. Its only town is named Dewey, after Admiral George Dewey, a hero of the American-Spanish War of 1898. The local people are more apt to call it Pueblo.
Culebra is full of natural beauty: beaches (Flamenco is the most celebrated), clear waters full of marine life, and land awash with flowers. Most people come just to sit on the beach or walk in the fresh air. Much of the island is now managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, to preserve the environment. It makes an interesting day trip from Puerto Rico and a total contrast to hot days in the streets of Old San Juan.
The Southeast
Traveling south from Fajardo you have the option of using Route 53 (a new toll road) or continuing on Route 3. Both roads lead past to the town of Humacao, and on toward the south coast. Just south of the Humacao is a left turn for Palmas del Mar, a growing resort area on the southeast coastline. A residential resort community built around wonderful stretches of beach, the resort offers numerous activities, including horseback-riding, fishing, golf (two courses), and a casino.
East of the town of Yabucoa you’ll find the start of the Ruta Panoramica. If you don’t have time to follow this entire trail, at least drive along Route 3 south of Yabucoa to the area around the Cendro la Pandura peak. The road climbs via a series of switchback turns, and once at the top you’ll have a clear view of the town lying in the flat plain below. The lifestyle of the people who live high on the hillside is fascinating. Jíbaros (country farmers) carry machetes to the fields, accompanied by their faithful hounds. Chickens scoot under cars as you approach. Around every turn, you’ll marvel at how the houses can be built on such precipitous slopes. The road then leads along the southern coastal plain through several small towns to Playa de Ponce.
Ponce
Puerto Rico’s second city, Ponce is as much steeped in history as Old San Juan. Founded in 1692, it was named after a relative of Juan Ponce de León, not the famous explorer himself. Ponce is a thriving port city, very modern in many ways, but it lives up to its name of “Pearl of the South.” At the very heart of the city is a jewel of an old town, well-preserved thanks to a massive and expensive restoration program begun in the 1980s. Hundreds of careworn buildings were brought back to life, and power cables were buried underground and out of sight. Along with this physical transformation came a cultural change: Ponce has become a focus for social events that celebrate Puerto Rican history and tradition; several major festivals are held here throughout the year.        
The focus of the city is Parque Degetau in Plaza Las Delicias (Delight Square), known by most locals as Plaza de Ponce. Most of what you want to see is within a few minutes’ walk of this plaza, and cafés and restaurants for refreshments are also near at hand. You can spend a wonderful morning just soaking in the atmosphere. The park, with its shady trees, cooling fountains, and somber bronze statues, including one of Luis Muñoz Marín, is where people come to take a break from the midday heat. There’s also a good ice-cream shop on the east side of the square.
At the heart of the square is the Cathedral of our Lady of Guadalupe, the city’s main place of worship since the late 1600s. Steady streams of visitors step inside to light a candle. Behind the cathedral is perhaps the most famous building in the city, the Parque de Bombas. This small museum to the city’s firefighters looks as though it were designed by a child and colored with crayons. Ornate wooden domes sitting atop four turrets that are painted in the brightest red and black stripes and highlighted with brilliant yellow. The structure was erected for a trade fair in 1882 and taken over by the bomba or firemen’s organization. The displays detail the bravery of individuals who fought fires in the once mostly wooden old town.
Casa Armstrong-Poventud (Armstrong-Poventud House) is the west side of the square. Once the family home of a Scottish-born banker and then later sold to the Poventud family, it’s now a cultural center that holds various exhibitions throughout the year. The Alcaldía (city hall) is also interesting. Three American Presidents (the two Roosevelts and Herbert Hoover) delivered speeches from the balcony here. Built in 1840, it served as the town jail until 1905.        
Radiating out from the main plaza are several roads, each of which with its own treasures. A number of the historic buildings have been converted to museums, but many are still residential or commercial buildings in daily use. Strolling along the streets you’ll be able to admire the ornate Spanish colonial and neoclassical façades.
On Calle Isabel, east of the square, you’ll find the Ponce History Museum. The building was actually two family houses — Casa Salazar and Casa Zapatar — that were joined to make room for this fascinating collection of archive material. The exhibits document the history of the town since its founding. Photographs bring to life the changes in lifestyle over the centuries. The comprehensive information plaques are in Spanish only, but there are guided tours in English every hour.
Behind the museum on Calle Cristina is the La Perla Theater. This was one of the first neoclassical structures to be built in the city, in 1864. Destroyed by an earthquake in the 1910s, it was rebuilt in 1940 and thoroughly restored as part of the major renovations of the late 1980s. It is once again at the center of the cultural activity for which Ponce is famed.
Another noteworthy museum on Calle Isabel is in Casa Serrallés: the Museum of Puerto Rican Music traces the complicated development of the island’s distinctive musical legacy, from Amerindian influences to the blending of Spanish colonial musical styles.
One of the homes that has only recently opened its doors to visitors is Casa Wiechers Villaronga on Calle Reina. Designed in 1911 by Alfredo Wiechers for the Villaronga-Mercado family, it is full of elegant Art-Deco features.
Ponce is a lively town, and street vendors can be found on every corner. The town market at Calle Atocha, one block from the main square, operates as it has done for generations. Here you’ll find fresh vegetables and fruit galore.
Ponce also has some surprises outside the historic quarter. On El Vigía Hill, above the town to the north, are two interesting attractions. One is a 100-ft (301⁄2-m) high cross that overlooks the city. Known locally as Cruz del Vigía, it was built in 1984; this concrete cross replaced a wooden one from the last century. There is an observation area at the point at which the arms spread; from here you can get a panoramic view over Ponce and out toward the coast.   
Set just below Cruz del Vigía, one of the finest houses in Ponce, Castillo Serrallés (Serrallés Castle) is not a castle but actually a spectacular family home built in the 1930s for the Serrallés family, owners of the Don Q rum company. With its red-tiled roof and pastel pink exterior, the structure is a lovely example of the Spanish Revival style. It is full of beautiful furniture owned by various family members. The gardens have been designed in formal French style, with lots of carefully trimmed box hedges and expansive lawns; from here you can look down on Ponce town. Since 1986 the house has been owned by the Ponce Municipal Government, which now operates it as a museum and meeting center.
South of the historic town center, on Avenue of the Americas (a modern two-lane highway) is the Museo de Arte de Ponce (Ponce Art Museum). This collection of European and Puerto Rican art, probably the finest in the Caribbean, would be very much at home in any European capital. The museum is the brainchild of Luis Ferré, industrialist and onetime governor of Puerto Rico, who has put great effort into bringing works of art to the town. More than 1,600 paintings and sculptures make up the collection, which covers five centuries of western art. The Flemish collection features work by Paul Bril (1554–1626) and David Teniers (1610–1690). The Spanish collection has a piece by El Greco (1541–1614). Nicholas Maes (1632–1693) is represented in the Dutch collection, and British artists include Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), Thomas Gainsborough (1727–1788) and George Romney (1734–1802). Pride of place is taken by the painting Flaming June, by Frederick Lord Leighton (1830–1896). The gallery offers a guided tour in English every afternoon at 2pm.
The city of Ponce actually sits some 3 miles (5 km) inland, but the local residents take every opportunity to go to the coast. The city beach is kept passably tidy by litter patrols. One spot where you’re bound to meet the locals is La Guancha, a boardwalk area between the beach, Ponce Marina, and the commercial docks. It’s a great place for strolling and gazing out over the water. There’s a tower to climb if you want a bird’s-eye view. Numerous kiosks sell cold beer and Puerto Rican snacks. The area’s always buzzing at weekends.
While at La Guancha you may see groups of people across the narrow bay staring down into the water. More likely than not, they’re trying to catch sight of the giant tarpon that have taken to swimming around in the shallows. Hundreds of these fish — some are up to 7 ft (2 m) long — congregate here because they’ve learned they’ll be well supplied with tasty tidbits offered by the humans on shore.
North of Ponce are attractions of a different kind. Take Route 503 out of town — this road runs along the banks of the Río Portuguéz — and after about a mile and a half (2 km) you’ll arrive at the Tibes Indian Ceremonial Park, one of the most important Amerindian archaeological sites in the Caribbean. The ceremonial site and cemetery are across the river, and you may not enter without a guide. A small museum explains the known history of the Amerindian races; it has a number of cabinets holding artifacts, as well as a skeleton, still in the traditional fetal burial position. Once you’re into the park, the ceremonial grounds come into view. Open spaces discovered since the 1960s are now believed to be used for “ball games,” which had an important though as yet only poorly understood ceremonial purpose in Indian culture.
High in the hills behind Ponce is Hacienda Buena Vista. To get there, take Route 10, a major north-south artery. The road climbs steeply into dense vegetation and cooler air before you see signs for the hacienda; the climate and environmental conditions here were ideal for the coffee that the plantation began to grow more than 150 years ago. The plantation fell into neglect in the 20th century, but since 1984 it has been returned to its original state by The Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico. Agricultural machinery such as coffee bean huskers can be seen in the original buildings, and the water mill and canals, which harnessed the power of the Canas River, are now in working order. The facility shows how plantations used to operate and offer a fascinating insight into agricultural life in Puerto Rico all those years ago. Advance reservations are required for the tours (see page 64).
The Southwest
West of Ponce there are a number of bosques estatales (state forests) and acres of farmland with grazing cattle and commercial stables. Rainfall is much lighter here than in the east, and the forests are more temperate than tropical.
Further east along Route 116 you’ll reach La Parguera, a small town on the south coast surrounded by thousands of acres of mangroves. A pretty town with a seaside atmosphere, it is a popular vacation spot for city-dwelling Puerto Ricans. One of the most enticing activities in La Parguera is exploring the mangroves (some of the tunnels are hundreds of yards deep) and the small offshore islands where you can picnic, swim, and snorkel all day. The waters offshore are full of sea-life and wonderfully clear. (Rental boats are available.)
Just east of La Parguera is Phosphorescent Bay, known for its glowing water filled with micro-organisms. Over the years many residents have built houseboats on the margins of the mangrove, and this has caused problems for the sensitive environment of the bay. The situation is said to be improving now, as new environmental controls are being put into place.
Heading west beyond La Parguera, you’ll need to use secondary roads, but these are in surprisingly good condition and relatively quiet. It’s almost a pampas landscape here, with grassy slopes and horses galore. Boquerón, a small village on the west coast, has arguably the most beautiful balneario (public beach) on Puerto Rico, a long arc of fine sand backed by sea grapes and palm trees. The settlement is growing due to its popularity, and a new marina is taking shape, but it still retains the feel of its origins as a fishing village. When the catches arrive, small temporary stalls are set up around the tiny town square. You can buy fresh clams and oysters, which can be shucked for you to eat as you go. There are a few small hotels here, which soon fill up on weekends and holidays, but if you arrive midweek or out of season, you may find that you are the only visitors.
The Faro de Cabo Rojo (Cabo Rojo Lighthouse) has been sadly neglected, but the light still plays an important part in protecting shipping off the island. It sits atop some of the highest cliffs on Puerto Rico, a truly spectacular sight. But beware of going too close to the edge, as there are no fences here.    
Inland from La Parguera and Boquerón is pretty San Germán, once also set on the coast but moved inland after the original site was sacked several times. Built on an undulating hillside, the town is the epitome of the Spanish colonial style. Its two town squares have not yet been spoiled by neon fast-food signs. There’s much of architectural interest around the pretty promenades and grand houses. Over 200 named buildings are under protection, but unfortunately, as yet, there is no tourist information office in the town, and many of the buildings are neither identified nor open to the public. Just enjoy the beautiful views and stroll along the streets to take in all the detail.
The major building of importance here is the Iglesia Porta Coeli (Church of the Gate of Heaven), a tiny terra-cotta chapel and convent founded in 1606. It sits in the lower of two squares in the town. The heart of one of the most important religious communities on the island in its early years, it was later used as a schoolhouse and poorhouse before being handed over to the government in 1949. After renovations in 1960, it was opened to the public. The new complex includes the Museo de Arte Religioso (Museum of Religious Art), which features a collection of Puerto Rican santos, carved religious figures and icons.    
North of Boquerón is the city of Mayagüez, the major urban center of the west coast and the end of the Ruta Panoramica. The old city was destroyed in an earthquake in 1918; as a result, Mayagüez is less interesting in terms of architecture than other settlements. It is, however, a popular base from which to explore the west coast (there are frequent direct flights between Mayagüez and San Juan). A number of large international hotels offer a good standard of accommodation and facilities such as golf and casinos.
The University of Puerto Rico’s campus at Mayagüez has an internationally recognized Tropical Agriculture Research Center, which, among other activities, cultivates several hundred tropical species. The center is open to the public, but since it has no refreshment facilities or play areas for children, it’s for dedicated gardeners only.
Fifty miles (80 km) off the coast is Mona Island, called “the Galapagos of Puerto Rico.” This isolated place, characterized by a coastline of high cliffs, is home to turtles, iguanas, and endangered pelicans. There is no human settlement today, but there is evidence that Taíno Indians once lived here. Columbus is also said to have landed, as did Ponce de León. Camping trips of the “commune-with nature” variety can be arranged from Mayagüez.
The Northwest
The northwest of Puerto Rico is the surfing capital of the Antilles, with great waves rising offshore. Inland is some of the most beautiful and undeveloped karst landscape anywhere. The region produces most of the Puerto Rican coffee crop, once the only coffee drunk in the Vatican.
Once north of Mayagüez, head west on Route 115 to Rincón. This small town and low-key resort is the surfing center for all the beaches along the coast. North from town is Punta Higuaro, one of the most popular beaches, and the Faro de Rincón (Rincón Lighthouse). This warning tower, which is surrounded by a neat park area with a café and gift shop, makes an ideal platform for whale-watching. Groups of the leviathans pass here on their migrations. Telescopes allow you to scan the horizon for their watery exhalations.
Farther north along the coast, just south of the small town of Aguada, is a monument commemorating the landing of Cristóbal Colón on the island in 1493. Though no one is really sure of the precise landing site (Columbus is renowned for having been less than accurate in documenting his landing sites), the small park with its column and naïve paintings depicting Spanish colonization serves its purpose well.
North of the town of Aguadilla, traveling out toward the airport and Rafael Hernandez air force base, are a series of fine bathing and surfing beaches. The most famous is Crash Boat Beach, named after a shipwreck that happened just offshore. The beach is always busy, but the most exciting stretch is the northern section, where the fishing boats rest. Most hours of the morning there are ships coming ashore with their meager, but extremely fresh, catch. The boats are brightly colored and carefully tended to ensure that they are always in peak condition — not one is splintered or sun-bleached.
Traveling back along the northern coast there is little to draw the eye. Inland however, it’s a different story. South of the busy town of Arecibo are a number of attractions that would make a fine day-trip from San Juan (none is more than a 90-minute drive from the capital).
The Observatory sits in the heart of karst country, a region of archetypal limestone erosion. Wave upon wave of small smooth hillocks known as “haystacks” cover the land, and the roads bend and weave around these forested mounds and through small villages nestled in the valleys. The name “karst” is taken from a region of Yugoslavia that has these same geographical characteristics. One striking feature of all karst landscapes is that the erosion of the limestone layers by rainwater creates cave systems, where weaker rock is worn away from under stronger rock that remains intact. Puerto Rico has one of the most dramatic cave systems yet discovered, in an area known as Parque de las Cavernas del Río Camuy (Río Camuy Cave Park), a little way south of the Observatory, just off Route 129. Tourist trains carry passengers between the caves and sinkholes (deep vertical shafts created when cave roofs collapse) that make up the park. A long video (Spanish only) shows what to expect before you set out. The giant Cueva Clara (Clara Cave) is reached by descending into a sinkhole; once in its depths, a narrow entrance leads to a cavern of cathedral-like dimensions — it is said the largest section of the cave could hold the El Morro fort. The caves and sinkholes have taken millions of years to erode; many of the stalagmites and stalactites have been hundreds of thousands of years in formation. An underground river, the Río Camuy, is responsible for much of the work. It still flows today, enlarging its path through the rock.
The whole cave park is a truly awesome sight, with holes 300 ft (91 m) deep and 200 ft (61 m) across, and caves thousands of feet deep, all surrounded by pristine forest. Some say that the fountain of youth is here, in the clean water filtering through the limestone from the surface. You don’t have to believe the legends, but taste the water anyway — it’s very sweet, and it can’t hurt to wish just a little.
From Lares take Route 111 to reach the most important Amerindian site on Puerto Rico, the Parque Ceremonial Indígena Caguana (Caguana Indian Ceremonial Park). The park is set in a wide valley surrounded by limestone peaks, one of which is said to represent the supreme god of the Taínos. The several ceremonial ball courts discovered and excavated here suggest the site was one of the Indians’ major centers of worship. The Taínos were still living happily on the island when Columbus arrived in 1493; archaeological finds here date back to 1200 b.c. The ball courts, edged with stones — some with symbols carved on them — are set in fine gardens planted with many native tree species. A small museum displays pottery and other artifacts found at the site.
From Arecibo on the coast, it’s an hour along the fast Route 22 toll road to San Juan. Many of the villages and towns along the way are small industrial outposts for the suburbs of Cataño. Just before reaching the city, however, is a resort that is developing into an important provider of visitor accommodations. Dorado has several large resort hotels, all of which occupy private grounds near the pretty sandy beaches. These are self-contained hotels, with facilities such as golf courses and night-time entertainment. There is however, little tourist infrastructure in the immediate vicinity. The town of Dorado, with restaurants and shops, is 21⁄2 miles (4 km) from the nearest hotel along the strip. The Dorado resort area began life as a large plantation, owned by the Livingston family; the first hotel built here — the Hyatt Dorado Beach Hotel — incorporated the old plantation house into its original design.
Excursion to St. Thomas
The shopping mecca of the Caribbean, St. Thomas is the most densely populated of the three US Virgin Islands (the others are St. John and St. Croix). Easily reached from San Juan — just a 40-minute flight from Muñoz Marín International Airport — St. Thomas has become a “must-visit” island for many people. It’s a duty-free haven, where luxury goods can be 40% cheaper than at home. This is particularly advantageous to US citizens, who can claim an allowance of $1,200 per person, regardless of age. Many Puerto Ricans hop across for the day, to take advantage of the bargains. During the flight over from San Juan, you’ll be able to get a bird’s-eye view of most of the neighboring US and British Virgin Islands.
Charlotte Amalie
Warehouses built along the harbor by 17th- and 18th-century Danish merchants still play host to hundreds of traders. But now, instead of stocking such staples as cotton, flour, or salt, the stores are filled with the modern version of “pirate booty” — gold, gems, watches, and designer goods. The main shopping streets lie close to the waterfront. A series of narrow alleys are filled with craft, clothing, and jewelry shops, along with cafés and restaurants that provide welcome relief once you’ve become “shopped out.”
But Charlotte Amalie is not just a shopper’s paradise. There are historic gems to be discovered here as well. Perhaps the most prominent is Fort Christian, which sits to the east of downtown. Work on the fort began in 1671, to protect the harbor. The terra-cotta walls, pretty painted shutters, and crenellated clock tower give the building a cozy rather than a fearsome look. The interior has been transformed into a museum of life in the US Virgin Islands: colonial furniture, archive documents, and old photographs of the islands, people, and towns. Take a walk onto the walls of the fort for a wonderful view over the seafront and the colorful Vendors Plaza, a craft market under bright parasols that has a permanent home in the fort’s shadow.
Next to the fort is the pretty Legislature building with a classical façade painted bright lime green. Finished in 1874, the building was originally used as a barracks for troops based at the fort. Behind the fort and the Vendors Plaza is Emancipation Park, perhaps the one place in town where you can sit in the shade of the trees and enjoy the cooling sea breeze after your sightseeing and shopping. The park was named to commemorate the freeing of the slaves in 1848. Across Tolbod Gade is the Tourist Information Office, where you can pick up maps and other information. On the northern corner of Tolbod Gade is the main post office. Make your way in that direction, but don’t be tempted to turn right and head for the stores just yet. Take the steps to Kongens Gade, which is the street behind the Lutheran Church. The steps climb onto the steep hill that has many of the oldest and most important buildings of Danish Charlotte Amalie. The family houses of the merchants and civil servants where built high on this rise — named Government Hill — to take advantage of the cooling breeze. Kongens Gade itself has several buildings dating back to the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Hotel 1829, named for the year in which it was built, sits amid other fine homes. Walk past Hotel 1829 and pause at the steps beside it, which climb higher onto Government Hill. These are the 99 Steps, one of a series built by the Danes in the mid 1700s to allow pedestrian access to the town below. The 99 Steps are the longest in town, but whoever named the flight must have become tired toward the end and miscounted — there are in fact 103.
Before climbing the steps, make a small detour farther along Kongens Gade, past the Lutheran Parsonage (1725), to reach Government House, an archetypal colonial mansion. Now the office for the Governor of the USVIs, this 1867 structure was originally used for meetings of the Danish Colonial Council; it was totally renovated in 1974. Nearby is Seven Arches House Museum, once the home of a Danish master craftsman. The house has a “welcoming arms” staircase — fashionable in the 18th century — leading to the entrance. Renovated and filled with period furniture, walking through it is a step back in time.
Retrace your route to the 99 Steps and climb to the summit of Government Hill. At the top, just when you may feel in need of a rest, you’ll find Haagensen House, another renovated period property. Its original owner, Hans Haagensen, was a Danish banker. Those who don’t want to climb the steps can take a shuttle to Haagensen House from the Pampered Pirate gift shop on Norre Gade. The remains of Blackbeard’s Castle — said to be the home of the famous pirate, whose real name was Edward Teach — can also be seen here.
Perhaps one of the most beautiful and unusual buildings in Charlotte Amalie is the St. Thomas Synagogue, on Crystal Gade. This is the oldest synagogue building in continual use under the American flag. The Jewish congregation has always been strong here, from the very earliest days of Danish settlement in 1655. When the all-consuming fire of 1831 broke out, 64 families were worshipping in the small synagogue. Only one scroll could be saved before the flames destroyed the building. The present structure was built on the same spot and opened in 1833. The synagogue has sand on the floor, symbolic of the Jewish flight from Egypt.
Beside the cruise port is Flag Hill, rising 700 ft (214 m) above sea level. From here you can enjoy the panoramic views over Charlotte Amalie, the surrounding hills, and the harbor. Paradise Point Tramway has been built to carry passengers to a platform, which is ideal for photographers. The seven-minute journey to the top gives a clear view of Havensight and the cruise port and there are is a café/bar in case you want to stop for refreshment.
Around the Island
Like most of the Virgin Islands, St. Thomas is full of hills. The roads twist and turn around sharp bends and roll up and over undulations. To see the main attractions of St. Thomas it’s best to head directly north up into the hills; you’ll be able to enjoy the beautiful views back towards Charlotte Amalie along the way. Drake’s Seat, thought to mark the spot where Francis Drake sat and watched ships moving to and from San Juan, offers breathtaking views of the northern coastline and Magens Bay, the site of what is probably the best beach on St. Thomas, and one of the most famous in the Caribbean. Estate St. Peter Greathouse and Botanical Gardens takes up 11 acres (41⁄2 hectares) along the ridge top near the summit of St. Peter peak. The estate was established in the 1800s and was owned in the 1930s by Virgin Islands Governor Lawrence Cramer. Both the house and the gardens were totally destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Today they are back to their beautiful best, and the house has been restored to combine history with modern amenities. The observation deck around the house is the perfect perch from which to admire the view. If you’re feeling more energetic, follow the nature trail through the garden.
At nearby Mountain Top — 1,547 ft (472 m) above the bay, and higher than Drake’s Seat — you’ll find a sophisticated shopping mall and large bar area with almost non-stop daiquiris (they claim to have invented the banana daiquiri here). Everyone comes with a camera, so you may have to wait a while to get a shot of the view.
Magens Bay is a beautiful stretch of sand with a slight kink in the center, which gives it the epithet “heart-shaped.” Because it is so sheltered, it’s a safe place for children to swim and for everyone to snorkel, though it can get very busy. In the rolling hillside behind the beach is Mahogany Run Golf Course, so you could have a round in the morning and swim and snorkel in the afternoon.
On the eastern end of the island, amid a number of large hotel complexes, is Coki Point, a pleasant beach. At the end of the point is Coral World, which offers a fascinating look at life under the water. The attraction centers around a number of different controlled marine environments, each with its own animals or fish. Watch out for the sting-ray, shark, and turtle pools, where regular feeding times are posted; you’ll even get a chance to pet some of the exhibits. Pride of place at Coral World must go to the genuine coral reef, which has been implanted in the open water offshore. An underground viewing area reached via a walkway allows you to observe the daily activity of the reef fish and some of the larger wild creatures who swim in for the free food provided by Coral World staff.
Coki Beach is popular spot for snorkelers, simply because there is so much sea-life here, thanks to the regular feedings provided by Coral World around their reef. Many of the cruise ships bus their passengers in here for snorkeling so it can get busy, but you are almost always guaranteed a good show of marine life.

./written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Berk/CH4.txt:An important point to note is that many contemporary toys undermine imagination and self-regulation. Aggressive toys are the most worrisome. Preschoolers who transform a stick or block into a weapon are doing little more than exploring a pervasive aspect of their culture. But equipping children with realistic-looking guns, swords, shields, and other tools of warfare is tantamount to setting up a training ground in aggression. Such toys foster both pretend and real hostility among peers.90 Boys’ penchant for high activity, excitement, and risk taking and their view of weaponry as the ultimate in masculinity attract them to war toys. Furthermore, when boys play with action ﬁgures modeled on violent TV and movie characters, such as Power Rangers, Transformers, and X-Men, their play narrows to mimicking the characters’ televised behavior and is generally aggressive and stereotyped. Video games with violent plots in which children advance by shooting and evading the enemy are yet another fantasy pursuit that largely appeals to boys. A growing number of studies conﬁrm that heavy playing of such games duplicates the effects of violent TV by promoting aggression and desensitizing children to violence.91 Furthermore, video games, even more than TV, are riddled with ethnic and gender stereotypes.92
./written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Berk/ch7.txt:Nevertheless, preference is not the same as appropriateness. Children sometimes choose toys with very limited play possibilities and soon ignore them. Other toys should not be given to children because they encourage undesirable play behaviors. Guns and other forms of weaponry fall into this category. In Chapter 4, I pointed to research demonstrating that these aggressive play materials promote both make-believe and real hostility in children’s interactions with peers.

The Museu Militar (Military Museum) has an extensive collection of antique weaponry and armor, lead soldiers of different epochs, and models of Catalan castles. Here in a basement room you’ll find what may be the only statue of Generalíssimo Francisco Franco to be seen in Barcelona today. The fort has somber associations for the city: Its cannons bombarded the population to put down rebellions in the 18th and 19th centuries, and it was the site of political executions, including that of Lluís Companys, president of the Generalitat of Catalonia during the Civil War, who was shot by a firing squad in 1940.

His visit to East Berlin in October 1989 for the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic left it clear that Soviet troops would no longer shore up its regime. The Berlin Wall was opened on 9 November 1989, and at midnight on 3 October 1990, a huge black, red, and gold national flag was hoisted at the Reichstag. East and West Berlin were again one.

(Or you can take a minibus, which runs from King’s Square to the fort every 15 minutes.) The setting of the fort — on a rocky promontory with sandy beaches on both flanks — is spectacular, with strong walls rising on all sides. The fort was begun as early as 1614 but has been upgraded throughout Bermuda’s history. Major renovations took place in 1793, 1820, and 1840 as technology improved and weaponry developed. The last major upgrade was completed in 1878. Explore the outer walls and impressive battlements before visiting the exhibitions housed in the interior. Collections of antique weapons, including swords and muskets, outline the progress made in weapons technology. Replicas of the crown jewels housed in the Tower of London can also be found here.

./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-History.txt:For the West Coast peoples, as the song says, the living was easy. The fish were indeed jumping; bountiful salmon were barbecued in the summertime, smoked for the winter. Prehistoric techniques for fishing and trapping have continued right into modern times, though bone has been replaced by steel in the weapons. One of British Columbia’s favorite freshwater fishing sites, at Hell’s Gate in Fraser Canyon, has been going strong for 9,000 years. Prairie Indians hunted buffalo by forcing the herds onto marshland, snowbanks, thin ice, or over cliffs — one of these nasty surprises being known to this day as the Head-Smashed-In buffalo jump, near Fort MacLeod, Alberta. Already in 3000 b.c. these people were drying and smoking strips of meat — modern beef jerky. In Ontario and Québec, where encroaching forests gradually dispersed the herds of caribou, the Iroquois ousted the Algonquin and settled down to cultivate maize, beans, and squash, living in rectangular, multifamily longhouses.

Stewart Museum is a restoration of the fort commissioned by the Duke of Wellington 60 years later. The military drills and parades staged here in the summer by uniformed students pay appropriate homage to both French and British (more precisely, the Scots Highlander) tradition. The fort’s Military and Maritime Museum displays ship models, maps, navigational instruments, and Canada’s weapons and uniforms from the 17th century to World War II. Beyond Jacques Cartier Bridge, La Ronde amusement park plays every imaginable ultramodern variation on the swings and roundabouts of a country fair. Put the kids on the Gyrotron whirligig or Aquapark waterslide and watch (or forget about them) from the beer garden. The closest Montréal can take you to the tropics is among its exotic fish in the Aquarium on the other side of Dolphin Lake (Lac des Dauphins) from the waterslide park.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:In summertime the garrison comes to life with the Changing of the Guard (10am daily, June 24–first week of Sept.) and Beating the Retreat (6pm Wed–Sat during July and August). The old powder house serves now as the Musée Militaire, displaying the regiment’s history with its trophies, weapons, and uniforms.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:Also on the harbor, the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic (1675 Lower Water Street,) is housed in a turn-of-the-century ship chandlery, setting the tone with a nostalgic whiff of tarred rope in the restored shop on the ground floor. The museum traces the dockyards’ 200-year history, displaying naval instruments, weapons, and some superb ship models from sail to steam, including the Aquitania ocean liner. A special section is devoted to shipwrecks on the notorious Sable Island. Berthed at the museum’s wharf is the 1913 survey vessel, Acadia, that charted the coasts of eastern Canada from Nova Scotia to Hudson Bay.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:For a good panoramic view of Halifax and a sense of its important military history, make your way around the grassy slopes leading to the star-shaped Citadel, from which a cannon-shot has boomed across the town each day at noon since the 1850s. A good guided tour takes you around the garrison, originally built for 300 British soldiers. It is surrounded by a deep, wide, dry moat, thick walls, and fortified grass-covered earthworks. The Cavalier Building has been restored to the way it was in 1869 and is now an Army Museum with uniforms, weapons, and the models of three previous city fortresses. The South Magazine stored powder barrels uncomfortably close to military prisoners who were kept, with the cannons, in the Garrison Cells. Canadian troops used the Citadel as barracks in both world wars, while anti-aircraft batteries were installed there in World War II. In summer, students in the kilted uniform of the 78th Highlanders perform infantry and artillery drills. The Nova Scotia Tattoo stages more spectacular military bagpipe parades, highland dances, singing, and a Naval Gun Run competition at the nearby Halifax Metro Center in late June, early July.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:The town’s most attractive piece of greenery is Point Pleasant Park, whose beach and shady woods make it ideal for picnics. At the southern tip of the Halifax peninsula, the park provides a fine vantage point from which to watch the big ships in the harbor and the yachts on the Northwest Arm. Among old ruined fortifications is the still intact Prince of Wales Martello Tower, a massive stone structure serving as barracks, weapons storage, and artillery platform, built by Prince Edward in 1796.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:Spend a more sober moment in the fascinating Glenbow Museum (130 Ninth Avenue S.E.). Beautifully arranged exhibits of furniture, costumes, utensils, and weapons give a vivid picture of Alberta life, from the pioneers’ log-cabin homesteads to the modern artifacts of oil-drillers, railway-builders, and miners. One evocative exhibit of the Great Depression of the 1930s is a farm girl’s party dress bejeweled with scores of safety pins arranged in patterns. The life of Ojibwa and Cree Indians is displayed in tepees, magnificent buffalo robes, and beaded buckskin, dance masks, and snowshoes.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt:Christopher Columbus knew these streets, and he prayed at the Ermita de San Antonio Abad before setting off on his first Voyage of Discovery to the New World. The present building dates from the 18th century. Close by on Calle Colón is the beautiful 15th-century Casa de Colón; this elegant house with its charming courtyard was formerly the residence of the island’s first governor, and Columbus is said to have stayed here on three occasions. Now an atmospheric museum, it recreates the Age of Discovery with exhibits of navigational instruments, charts, weapons, and everyday items of the period.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Cancun-History.txt:In 1537 another force, under the command of Montejo el Mozo (the Younger), Don Francisco’s son, set out to plant the Spanish standard on Yucatecan soil. At first ill fortune dogged them; the dwindling force was besieged in Champotón, on the west coast, for two miserable years. With reinforcements, the Spaniards managed to establish a beachhead. A band of only 57 men, led by Montejo el Mozo’s cousin (yet another Don Francisco), marched inland to take the Mayan village of T’Ho. The Indians gathered their forces for one last great battle, and thousands of them fell upon the Spanish camp, now defended by 200 men. The horses and superior weaponry of the Spaniards gave them the edge, and they slaughtered hundreds of Indian warriors. After the battle, local chiefs made peace with the invaders and, on 6 January 1542, the Montejos founded the Spanish city of Mérida on the site. 
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Cancun-History.txt:In 1847, a savage uprising known as the Caste War saw Mayan rebels massacre white settlers and take control of nearly two-thirds of the peninsula. By 1850 they had driven the Mexicans back to their strongholds in Mérida and Campeche. However, in an amazing turnaround, the Maya’s ancient beliefs became their undoing. Just when the Mexicans were on the point of surrender, the rains came early and the Indians, obedient to their gods, dropped their weapons and returned to their milpas to plant the sacred corn. The settlers called in reinforcements and wreaked a terrible revenge on the natives. One group of rebels, known as the Chan Santa Cruz, held out in the jungles of Quintana Roo around the city of Tulum, harrying the Mexicans and making the east coast of the Yucatán a dangerous area, off-limits until well into the 20th century.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/China-History.txt:The great Han Dynasty (206 b.c.–a.d. 220), which followed the Qin, consolidated the imperialistic order. Civil servants were selected by competitive exams, the centralized government standardized currency, and the “Silk Road” across central Asia opened up trade with the rest of the world. On the military front, the Han triumphed over marauding Huns and the Central Asian nomads, and Chinese sovereignty was extended almost to today’s frontiers. The development of a new crossbow — which was a longer-range and more accurate weapon than China’s foes could deploy — ensured Han supremacy.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Nepal-WhereToGo.txt:On the road back to town, stop at the National Museum to admire its small but select collection of art and artifacts. Here are Licchavi stone reliefs of Shiva and Parvati from the fifth and sixth centuries, the classical period of sculpture. Figures are slimmer and more graceful than the more common balloon-breasted models of the Mallas. A lovely eighth-century Birth of Buddha is curiously reminiscent of Christian nativity scenes. A great Bhairav urn and a comical terra-cotta Ganesh are noteworthy. There’s also a separate wing that holds a collection of Buddhist iconography. The historical wing is filled with ancient weapons, including a leather cannon that must have given gunners a few anxious moments.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:El Morro was one of the most formidable citadels in the world. During the 16th and 17th centuries it was one of a ring of forts that held the key to Spanish power in the Caribbean. The watchtowers of El Morro look out to sea and inland across San Juan Bay to the coastal plains beyond. The multilevel defenses made it possible to fire weapons from sea level up to hundreds of feet above ground. Despite some serious attempts by English and Dutch forces, the fort was never forcibly taken.
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:Take a left and a block farther down you’ll enter Plaza de Armas. This was the first central square of Old San Juan, and the City Hall, or Alcaldía, still sits on its northern side. The army used to drill here, hence the name (armas means weapons, or arms), but today it is simply a place for people to meet and have a coffee, or sit and chat. Workers enjoy picnic lunches here at midday; old people while away the afternoon. The Alcaldía has an interesting interior, with checkerboard marble floors and magnificent chandeliers. It’s usually open on weekdays; you can check with the tourist information office on the ground floor as to whether it’s OK to wander around.
